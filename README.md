# üåê Informea API Redevelopment - UNEP Corporate Services Division (2022)

Hello, tech enthusiasts and data aficionados! üöÄ

Welcome to the repository showcasing my work on redeveloping the open-source Informea API in PHP. This project was a significant part of my internship with the UNEP Corporate Services Division in 2022. The aim was to enhance the API to efficiently retrieve documents and data, and seamlessly integrate this information into Azure Data Lake for the BI and Science Division teams. 

## üåü Project Overview

In 2022, during my internship at UNEP, I embarked on an exciting mission to revamp the Informea API. The original API was a great tool, but it required some enhancements to meet the evolving needs of the UNEP Corporate Services Division. My redevelopment focused on making the API more robust and efficient in fetching and processing data, ultimately facilitating its integration into Azure Data Lake. This integration enabled the BI and Science Division teams to leverage the data for advanced business intelligence and scientific analysis.

## üîß Key Features

- **Enhanced Data Retrieval:** 
  - Upgraded methods for querying and fetching documents and data.
  - Improved error handling and response times to ensure reliable data access.
  
- **Azure Data Lake Integration:**
  - Seamless transfer of retrieved data to Azure Data Lake.
  - Support for large-scale data storage and easy accessibility for further processing.

- **Performance Optimization:**
  - Refined the API‚Äôs performance for faster data retrieval and processing.
  - Implemented caching mechanisms to reduce redundant data requests and improve efficiency.

- **Documentation & Usability:**
  - Updated API documentation to reflect the new features and improvements.
  - Provided clear instructions and examples for developers on how to use the enhanced API.

## üíª Technologies Used

- **PHP:** 
  - The core programming language used to develop and enhance the Informea API.
  
- **Azure Data Lake:**
  - Used for storing and managing large volumes of data retrieved from the API.
  
- **Informea API:**
  - The original open-source API that was redeveloped and customized.
  
- **RESTful API Design:**
  - Employed for efficient and scalable data retrieval and integration.

- **Additional Tools:**
  - **Postman:** For testing and debugging API endpoints.
  - **Git:** For version control and collaborative development.

## üìö How It Works

1. **Data Retrieval:**
   - The redeveloped API uses improved methods to query and retrieve documents and data from the Informea source. This includes optimized search functionalities and enhanced data extraction techniques.

2. **Data Transformation:**
   - Once retrieved, the data is processed and transformed to fit the required format for integration with Azure Data Lake. This involves data cleaning, normalization, and enrichment.

3. **Loading to Azure Data Lake:**
   - The processed data is uploaded to Azure Data Lake, where it is stored securely and made accessible for further analysis. This step ensures that the data is available for BI and Science Division teams to use in their projects.

4. **Accessibility & Utilization:**
   - Teams can access the data through Azure Data Lake, allowing them to perform advanced analytics, generate reports, and make data-driven decisions.

## üöÄ How to Dive In

- **Explore the Code:**
  - Navigate through the PHP code to understand the enhancements made to the Informea API.
  
- **Understand the Workflow:**
  - Review the integration process and data flow from retrieval to storage in Azure Data Lake.

- **Contribute:**
  - Contributions and improvements are welcome! Feel free to fork the repository, submit pull requests, or open issues if you encounter any problems or have suggestions.

- **Testing:**
  - Use the provided test cases and Postman collections to verify the functionality of the API.
