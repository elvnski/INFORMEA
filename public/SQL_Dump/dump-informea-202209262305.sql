This will remove the need to complete a due diligence. \nDear Michelle, \nIndeed, form the information in the website, so it seems to be public university, hence it would fall under government. Though this is not always straight forward since it also depend on national regulatory frameworks about the public / Administration sector. \nThe Legislative Decree No. 12 of 1986 with Respect to Establishing and Organizing the University Of Bahrain (http://www.uob.edu.bh/en/images/About_UOB/UoB_Establishment_Decrees.pdf) indicates, as you mentioned in your email, that it is a independent scientific public body (article I). \nThere are other pieces of information that seem to confirm that this a public university: \nArticle 34 makes reference to the budget. A portion comes from the State: The University\'s budget revenues shall consist of: a) The annual amounts allotted for the University in the State Budget. b) Return of its fixed and movable revenues. c) Donations, gifts, grants, bequests and endowment that the Board of Trustees approves. d) University fees and educational services and research fees. e) Any other revenues stated in the laws and bylaws. \nThe website makes reference to the a meeting of the Board of Trustees held in 2017. The chairmanship of the Board is under the Minister of Education (http://www.uob.edu.bh/en/index.php/15-slider/1627-board-of-trustees-uob-to-develop-graduate-programs-and-establish-new-disciplines). \nThe university has 26,000 students. Normally, private university except perhaps in large countries do not have such large enrollement. \nThe meeting of the board makes reference to the “annual report to assess the academic, administrative and financial aspects of the University and its strategic plan” and to the report of the Audit and Finance Committee and its recommendations”. Those documents might also confirm the public status of the university. I could not find them in the website. \nThe following top universities website also features the University of Bahrain as a public university (https://www.topuniversities.com/universities/university-bahrain/undergrad).\nEventually, you might also with to check the GUPES (Global University Partnership on Environment and Sustainability) colleagues at the Ecosystems Division.\nBest regards.\nIsabel',17,'2018-07-02 04:41:30',NULL,NULL,0),(113,496,NULL,NULL,NULL,1,'AssesmentQuestions','partners','OK.

Is the status of the partner still to be reviewed by the Legal Unit to advice on whether the partner is Corporate Philanthropic Foundation considered a private sector or an NGO Foundation? or it is just the Partnership Committee to review the dossier and provide their comments. \n\n2.	In any case, having reviewed the entire dossier, the partner’s founding documents are not uploaded in the portal. This makes it difficult to know the partner’s status and whether it is a Corporate Philanthropic Foundation or an NGO Foundation. It would be best if we could get the Articles of Association or the Certificate of incorporate to assist with this. I would suggest that this document should be uploaded on the portal for future reference. \n\n3.

As to the status of the partner, the original founding documents of the partner have not been uploaded in the portal. The only document that is attached is the letter dated 2 June 2004 from the Department of the Treasury which relates to the tax status of the partner. Per this document, n 1952, the Asia Foundation was given a document that recognized that the Foundation was exempt from paying taxes. The document in 2004 confirms that the Foundation is not a private foundation within national laws in the US. \n\nThis letter however is not the original document for the status of the partner. The original document should be obtained and uploaded on the partnership portal. @Junko Fujioka \n\n2. According to the information received from Junko, UNEP IETC in Japan has a valid SSFA with the Asia Foundation, represented by their Mongolia Office, to undertake the first phase of a waste and climate change project. It is not clear whether the partner was already reviewed under the old partnership prior to concluding the SSFA with them.\n\nPer the email from Junko dated 19 June 2018, the SSFA is coming to an end soon, and IETC wants to have a new PCA with them again to continue the remaining activities of the same project.). \n\n@Junko Fujioka Did IETC confirm that the partner was reviewed and cleared as a previous UN Environment partner before signing the SSFA? \n\n3. That said, having reviewed the partners website and activities carried out by the partner per their website, I note that the Asia Foundation according to their website, the Asia Foundation is a nonprofit international development organization which aims to improve lives across a dynamic and developing Asia. It has six decades of experience and deep local expertise, and their work spread across the region addresses five overarching goals—strengthen governance, empower women, expand economic opportunity, increase environmental resilience, and promote regional cooperation.\n\nI understand that UN Environment intends to engage with the Asia Foundation through a PCA to implement project activities.\n\nI have no objection to the partnership but would recommend the founding documents are uploaded onto the portal.\n',2125,'2018-07-13 11:13:14',NULL,NULL,0),(129,172,NULL,NULL,NULL,1,'AssesmentQuestions','partners','The Due Diligence question on sensitive industries was changed to reflect information on the Company website.

UN Environment is considering entering into partnership with Blue Finance and two other organizations to establish a finance facility for sustainable oceans and coasts. There are also two small scale funding agreements (SSFAs) in the pipeline. The concerns have been looked into by talking to people who have worked with Blue Finance. \nBased on the information from the conversations with people that have been working with Blue Finance the following concerns and comments should be considered: \n-	Blue Finance is a two-man’s show. \n-	Blue Finance is perceived as difficult to work with, and Blue Finance is not good at interacting with relevant stakeholders at local and national level. Blue Finance has been described as overwhelming, abrasive and pushy. Stakeholders feel they are not consulted in the right way. \n-	Regarding the quality of the work and the deliverables Blue Finance has produced concerns been raised. It is difficult to say whether the information Blue Finance is sharing is accurate and corresponds to the actual situation.\n-	Blue Finance has been described a very good at selling its work, but that its deliverables do not always meet the expectations. \n-	Blue Finance is strong on technical issues and has the required technical expertise and knowledge.

I noticed the following issues with the system:\n\n1) the online review for the partnership portal only allows the Legal Unit to make comments. Now the system does not allow the Legal Unit to insert their changes/edits in track change mode. In reviewing the draft template, the Legal Unit needs to be able to make these changes in track change mode and these changes cannot be made through comments;\n2) The Legal Unit cannot view the modifications/changes @Benjamin Hickman has made to the draft MOU. It is important that these changes are reflected in the draft document in the portal. Without these changes being inserted in track changes, the Legal Unit will be required to review the entire document to identify these changes and this is not practical for all legal instruments. The insertion of track changes also allows the Legal Unit to know what changes have been made as the Legal Unit only reviews Legal Instruments that have substantial deviations from the standard template or changes with legal implications and not just simple changes made to the draft document. \n\nAs such I discussed with @Paul and he informed me that they are working on allowing changes to be made in the system.\n\nThe way forward should be as follows:\n\na) If there are substantial deviations in the template or deviations which have legal or corporate implications, kindly export that which is in the portal now and send an email to the Legal Unit informing us whether they are substantial deviations or just simple changes made;\nb) Upon receipt of the email from you @Benjamin Hickman the Legal Unit will approve the agreement in the system.\n\nJust a  few important issues that you may wish to change in the agreement before sending it to the Legal Unit:\n\ni) The acronym for the Organisation should be \"UN Environment and not \"UNEP\";\nii) the preamble provision on the mandate of UN Environment should read as follows: \n\nThe United Nations Environment Programme (hereinafter referred to as UN Environment\" is the leading global environmental authority that sets the global environmental agenda, promotes the coherent implementation of the environmental dimension of sustainable development within the United Nations system and serves as an authoritative advocate for the global environment;\n@Paul Maina, please could the template in the system be amended to reflect the above wording for the UN Environment\'s mandate?\niii) The second paragraph should capture the mandate of the respective UN Environment Office that is negotiating the agreement with the partner.\n\n@Paul Maina could you kindly work on the space for the comments as this is very small and it is hard to review the comments inserted here.

PERSGA’s member states include: Djibouti, Egypt, Jordan, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen.\nPERSGA’s legal basis stems from Article XVI of the Regional Convention for the Conservation of the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden, known as the Jeddah Convention, signed in 1982 which states as follow: “A Regional Organization for the Conservation of the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden Environment, the permanent headquarters of which shall be located in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, is hereby established\". It was not until September 1995, however, with the signing of the Cairo Declaration during the First Council Meeting in Egypt, that PERSGA’s creation was formally announced.

According to a Financial Times article published on November 19, 2018 China\'s Anti-Monopoly Bureau has evidence of large-scale violations of the country\'s antitrust laws allegedly committed by Samsung Electronics, SK Hynix, and Micron Technology. Authorities had launched investigations in late May 2018 on suspicions that the companies fixed prices of Dynamic Random-Access Memory chips (DRAM chips) following a reported 47 percent price hike for these products in 2017. The companies, whose offices were reportedly raided, could face fines of up to $2.5 billion each. DRAM chips are reportedly used in Apple\'s and Huawei\'s smart phones and in computers produced by Samsung. Separately, in early November 2018, the US administration launched criminal proceedings against Fujian Jinhua for alleged theft of trade secrets. (Translated from French) https://bit.ly/2Fmkct9 \n\nLegal cases involving Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd.:\nDisclaimer: the legal cases mentioned within this news report are not exhaustive.\n1)	United States authorities have accused the Chief Finance Officer (CFO) Meng Wanzhou of Huawei Technologies in giving misleading statements to banks about its relationship with Skycom Tech, which operated in Iran, causing the banks to process hundreds of millions of dollars in transactions that may have violated US sanctions against Iran. Huawei in fact operated Skycom as an unofficial subsidiary (Skycom was reportedly dissolved in 2017). During one presentation in 2013 to an international bank, the CFO supposedly stated that Huawei and Skycom were unrelated, leading banks to clear its transactions. https://cnb.cx/2FhKE72 \n\nThe US Department of Justice had initiated a criminal probe into the said matter after subpoenas had been issued from the Department of Commerce and the Office of Foreign Assets Control. A Vancouver court granted the CFO, a CAD 10 million ($7.5 million) bail after she was arrested by local authorities at the request of the US government. Under the conditions of the bail, Meng must wear an ankle monitor and stay at her Canadian domicile between certain hours. Furthermore, five of Meng’s friends pledged equity in their homes and funds as a guarantee that the CFO will not leave the country. https://on.wsj.com/2QA0tLB\n\n2)	Singapore’s High Court ordered Huawei to pay $36 million in damages to Creative Technologies (CT) for breaching a contract related to a wireless network project. In 2010, CT contracted Huawei to design, build and operate wireless network in Singapore called WiMax. Under the terms of the agreement, Huawei was required to provide nationwide wireless coverage with 225 base stations. In 2012, CT filed a lawsuit against Huawei and claimed that the company miscalculated and misrepresented the cost of the network. https://bit.ly/2D3FjxU \n\n3)	Ukraine-based subsidiaries of multinational companies including Huawei Ukraine, and others have been accused of evading a total of UAH 1.5 billion in taxes using a scheme to pay the out-staffing companies Promotion Outsourcing and Promotion Staff for fictitious services for five years. Meanwhile, the defence of the accused companies has alleged that the expert\'s report provided by the Research Information and Consultation Center, which found that state coffers received over UAH 955 million ($33 million) less tax revenues, and was conducted with severe violations of Ukrainian legislation. https://bit.ly/2SOPDzc\n\n4)	Poland has arrested a Chinese employee of Huawei and a Polish national involved in cyber-business on allegations of spying, Polish state media has reported, deepening the controversy over western criticism of the Chinese telecoms company. However, a spokesman for the Polish security services told Reuters the allegations are related to individual actions, and were not linked directly to Huawei. US intelligence agencies claim Huawei Technologies Co Ltd is linked to China’s government and its equipment could contain “backdoors” for use by government spies. No evidence has been produced publicly and the company has repeatedly denied the allegations. But the criticism has led several western countries and businesses to consider whether they should allow Huawei’s equipment to be used in their telecoms networks. https://bit.ly/2TLU4ek \n\n',2190,'2019-01-14 13:47:14',NULL,NULL,0),(721,479,NULL,NULL,NULL,1,'Comments','partners','Dear Mohammed, I have included the comments to your questions, but I am not sure you received the tag for it.

This information in most cases than not should be obtained from the organization’s most recent annual reports and website. However, in the case of the current partner, while the legal status has been confirmed, there is no company website to obtain further information regarding the partner. The partner’s financial capacity cannot be evaluated since the partner has no financial statements as the entity was established in April 2018. As to the technical capacity of the partner the only information available is that found in the due diligence which indicates that the partner has worked with other UN Environment offices and the CBD Secretariat. In particular, the due diligence indicates that ESSA Synergy has been involved in the development of the previous fifth national CBD report and has been selected by the Macedonia Ministry of Environment and Physical Planning and Project Steering Committee to implement the project assignment. It is important to note that UN Environment partners are subject to an internal review and due diligence process which should allow UN Environment to individually engage such partners to minimize such risks associated with the engagement of such partners. Given the status of the partner, I would recommend a more thorough review of the partnership. My suggestions are as follows: a) Could the submitting office clarify the legal basis for the relationship on which the partner could implement such previous activities; b) The submitting office should attach any document signed with UN Environment- legal instruments or otherwise to indicate that the partner is engaged with UN Environment and what these deliverables are; c) Submitting office should provide reports from the partner and confirmation from the other UN Environment offices that the deliverables for previous activities implemented by the partner have been accomplished as required within UN Environment standards of evaluation. I understand that if such activities exist, these are ongoing tasks and therefore it is still difficult to evaluate the technical capacity of the partner. Until such activities are finalized and it is determined that the deliverables have been accomplished based on such reports. For record purposes, the portal should contain such information for audit purposes so that it is specifically clear why the partner is being approved.

Taking this into consideration, the Project Steering Committee has selected ESSA SYNERGY to develop the Sixth National Report to CBD.\nIn addition, the experts team (including mostly professors and academics) planned to be involved in the development of the Sixth National Report to CBD are already experienced and have been engaged for many years in many similar assignments, such as the Fifth National Report on CBD, National Nature Conservation Strategy, First and Second National Strategy on Biodiversity with Action Plans and so on. \nb) The submitting office should attach any document signed with UN Environment- legal instruments or otherwise to indicate that the partner is engaged with UN Environment and what these deliverables are:\nMrs. Menka Spirovska will be the main expert coordinator and responsible for the quality assurance of the deliverables.

MOUs are collaborative framework agreements and therefore should reflect general areas of cooperation such as climate change.

It simply states as follows: \"The UN Environment Regional Office West Asia will continuously monitor the partnership and the activities of GPIC and respond to risks that may arise accordingly.\" It is important that the West Asia Office identifies,  concrete steps that will be taken to respond to such risks which may arise. \n\n\nThat being said, I understand that GPIC has taken some steps to manage greenhouse gas emissions. They have done this by commissioning the Middle East’s first carbon dioxide recovery plant at GPIC in 2010. the plant has the capacity to capture 450 metric tons of carbon dioxide per day from the reformer flue gases to improve its carbon footprint. \n\nAnother way to ensure oversight and to ensure a reduction in risks is for the GPIC to consider being a partner in the Climate and Clean Air Coalition as a non-state partner. The Climate and Clean Air Coalition is a voluntary partnership of governments, intergovernmental organizations, businesses, scientific institutions and civil society organizations committed to improving air quality and protecting the climate through actions to reduce short-lived climate pollutants.\n\nCCAC was formed by the governments of Bangladesh, Canada, Ghana, Mexico, Sweden and the United States, along with the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), who came together to initiate efforts to treat short-lived climate pollutants as an urgent and collective challenge. They formed the Climate & Clean Air Coalition to support fast action and deliver benefits on several fronts at once: climate, public health, energy efficiency, and food security.\n',2125,'2019-05-22 07:59:40',NULL,NULL,0),(1130,1049,NULL,NULL,NULL,1,'PartnerSummary','partners','Having reviewed the documents for the engagement of this partner my comments are as follows:\n1.	This partner has no certificate of incorporation and no article of association uploaded on the partnership portal. I am therefore curious as to why the response on the question: \" are there any risks associated with the registration of this partner\" is \"No\" when there is no document to show that the partner is registered. \n\n2.	The name of the partner in the auditors document is ‘Targa” but the partner is referred to as “Targa Aide” in the partnership portal. It is not clear what the legal name of the partner is. Without the certificate of incorporation or Articles of Association, one cannot know the legal name of the partner. These documents should be obtained from the partner and uploaded on the partnership portal.\n\n3.	The partner has no website and there is no information available for this partner online either to indicate the partners mandate and activities carried out by the partner. In the table under the due diligence the FMO indicates that they have reviewed the website of the partner and found it to be operational and up to date. However, the link for the website for the partner was not provided in the partnership portal. If there is a link, this should be put in the portal so that it can be accessed. \n\n4.	It is not clear from the due diligence what the nature of the engagement with UN Environment is and how is this going to contribute to achieving UN Environment\'s mandate? \n\n5.	In the additional table under the due diligence, the entries indicate that on 3 May 2019, Fatma Twahir, the FMO reviewed the financial statements of the company. However, in the report from the external auditors for the years 1 January to 31 December 2016 (which is in French), the auditors have identified so many inconsistent in the accounts of the partner. \n\n6.	The due diligence indicates that the UN has partnered with Targa Aide before but there is no document uploaded to indicate such previous partnership or an evaluation of the delivery capacity of the partner.\n\n7.	I would suggest that the submitting office should provide more information for this partner regarding the activities to be implemented, previous engagements with the UN, an indication that the partner delivered on previous activities satisfactorily and that proper reports were provided for activities implemented.\n\n\n',2125,'2019-05-22 09:48:06',NULL,NULL,0),(1131,1686,1515,0,NULL,2,'AgreementSummary','agreements','Could you please advise!\n\nthe legal unit has approved this partnership, but our director could not approve it: https://apps1.unep.org/partners/agreements/view/1515\nI also noticed that I did not receive a notification from the system that it was approved by the legal\nthanks ',2073,'2019-05-23 11:31:40',NULL,NULL,0),(1132,753,1462,NULL,NULL,2,'AgreementSummary','agreements','Please address discrepancy between total agreement value and Payments',2519,'2019-05-23 11:44:10',NULL,NULL,0),(1133,753,1462,0,NULL,2,'AgreementSummary','agreements','Done.

It currently reads as follows:\n\nBased on the details of the 2018 Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) to jointly organize the Sixteenth Multilateral Environmental Agreement (MEA) course from 14-24 October 2019 at University of Siena in Italy, between UNEP and “UEF”, UNEP agrees to co-operate with UEF with respect to the project/programme entitled \"Addressing Environmental Challenges through the Law\" in Finland.\n\nTo my knowledge, the MoU of 2018 does not specifically speak of the sixteenth MEA course. Therefore it is not correct to refer to \"the details of the 2018 Memorandum of Understanding\" but simply, as suggested earlier, to the 2018 Memorandum of Understanding. Moreover, if the understanding is that the course will take place in Siena, then the sentence cannot, at the same time, say \"in Finland\" at the end.\n\nPara. 4 of the draft SSFA indicates that the ending date for implementation of activities is 31st December 2019, and yet the financial report is due on the 15th of December 2019 (see para. 7). The financial report cannot be due before all activities have been implemented. Moreover, it is unlikely that payments can be effected after 15 December 2019. Therefore, this deadline should be revisited. \n\nThe validity of the Agreement should also be revisited. Para. 14 talks of a six-month period. Ideally two months should elapse between the end of the implementation of activities under the SSFA and the expiration of the SSFA.\n\nOn Annexes B and C, the reporting period is indicated as starting from 15 November 2019 and ending on 31 December 2019. Activities begin well before this time.\n\nFinally, we need information on the administrative and financial contact at UEF (Annex D).

Under section 2, the same start date/event and due date applies to all the activities listed. This is inconsistent with the dates indicated in the project implementation plan.\n2. Under paragraph 4, the ending date for implementation of activities is 31st January 2020, while under paragraph 7, the due date for the substantive report and evaluation report of the Course and the financial report are 30th November 2019 and 15th December 2019. This implies that the substantive and financial reports and the evaluation report of the course are due before all activities under the SSFA are implemented. In addition, under Annex A, all the activities listed will end by October 2019, save for the submission of reports and the course evaluation. Thus, is it really necessary to indicate an implementation date of up to 31st January 2020?\n3. Paragraph 14 indicates that the SSFA shall remain valid for a period of 6 months from the date of latest signature. This would be December 2019 or January 2020, depending on when the latest signature is obtained. However, paragraph 4 provides that the ending date for implementation of activities is 31st January 2020. This means that the deadline for implementation of activities is likely to go beyond the validity of the SSFA.\n4. The second paragraph of Annex A refers to the Programme of Work 2019-2021. There is no such PoW. There is the PoW for 2018 and 2019 and the PoW for 2020 and 2021.\n5. Annexes B, C and D refer to a reporting period of from 30/11/2019 to 15/12/2019. However, based on Annex A, the first activity will take place in August 2019, and based on paragraph 4 of the SSFA, activities are to be implemented until 31st January 2020.\n\nIn sum, please make sure that the dates are aligned and consistent, i.e.:\n\n1. Completion of implementation of activities under the SSFA;\n2. Submission of reports, which should be at least a month from the completion of activities;\n3. Expiration of SSFA, which should be one to two months after submission of the financial report, to ensure sufficient time for the evaluation of the report and the processing of payment.

Hence, we selected the category, university (government) organization, as opposed to a non-profit making organization in the Partners portal.  Before I started to develop the agreement, I also had to make a new partner submission for validation in the Partners Portal. This is where we categorized DTU as university (government) organization.  Kindly see the validation email attached at the bottom of my email.  Therefore, we retain the clause as it is. \n\nAnswer 2)  The due dates have been harmonized in both documents: Activity 1. 30 Nov 2019; Activity 2. 23 September 2019; and Activity 3. 30 November 2019. \n\nAnswer 3)  It has been updated to reflect 23 Sept 2019 as the due date. \n\nAnswer 4)  Expected results have been added as requested.  \n\nAnswer 5)  Regarding Clause 4, in the Partners Portal, we need to specify an exact date because it does not allow me to write “upon signature of both parties”.  I indicated 19 August, thinking that it would not take long to process this.  Anyhow, now I have amended the date to be 1 September 2019.  I hope that the process would be completed by then. \n\nAs for the end date of the agreement, 31 December 2021 is the correct end date. We intend to have this SSFA as a multiyear agreement that will also include future EGR and AGR work.  As you may be aware, we work with DTU to produce EGR and AGR on a yearly basis.  We will certainly continue to work with them in foreseeable future.  When we have additional funding (which is expected) coming in, we will amend the agreement to include Activity 4, 5, … accordingly. Please also note that the PIMS Project ID 02041 where the EGR and AGR work is housed (and this Agreement is linked to) lasts until 31 December 2023.  So, the end date of this agreement being 31 December 2021 is within the end date of the project. Before submitting the agreement for your review, we already consulted with Nada and Tito whether there is any restriction in having an agreement for such a period of time, and they confirmed that as long as it is well within the project duration, it is acceptable. \n\nRegarding Clause 14, perhaps you are not aware that the standard clause has been changed by CSS in the portal.  This clause used to state the period of the entire agreement, but now it gives you the flexibility of indicating how many more months after the specified end date in clause 4.…\"..and shall remain valid for a period of 6 months, after the end date specified in clause 4 unless terminated earlier pursuant to clause 11 above.\"  I consulted with CSS and they said the default value (of months) is between 1 to 12 months. We discussed with DTU and decided to go with 6 months.  As a result, this agreement would remain valid for a period of 6 months after 31 December 2021. \n\nAnswer 6) Wire instructions updated to include:  IBAN: DK2430004183089927  and  SWIFT: DABADKKKXXX\n\nAnswer 7)  In Clause 7, we indicated that the date of substantive and financial reporting is 31 March 2020 for Activity 1, 2 and 3.  It should give DTU enough time to complete the reporting. \n',630,'2019-08-19 15:29:57',NULL,NULL,0),(1464,771,1692,NULL,NULL,2,'AgreementSummary','agreements','Please correct the dates and referred wording as per my email.

Here are the reasons why this is important and urgent:\n\n1.	The revised end-date will allow us to continue to engage DTU over the next-year’s EGR and AGR reports.  They will need to be delivered by 30 November 2020, prior to the UNFCCC Climate COP, as it has always been.  We cannot have a shorter duration for this SSFA, than that end-date (Dec. 2020), because it needs to fit the production cycles of both these reports. \n2.	As far as we know, per the existing guidance there is no clear restriction on the duration of a SSFA.  We understand your point about a potential concern when an audit is carried out; however, we would need to receive from you any relevant documents that talk about audit query related to an agreement longer than one year, to convince us of your point. If there is no such guidance, then we really need to go for an SSFA that runs until the end of December 2020 to allow for coherent and consistent, successful delivery of these key reports, one of which is a flagship knowledge product recognized as such by our new ED.  \n',630,'2019-08-21 14:01:41',NULL,NULL,0),(1477,1762,1766,NULL,NULL,2,'AgreementSummary','agreements','The changes proposed to the draft PCA appear to be related to reporting obligations only which should be reviewed and cleared by the concerned PO and FMO/AO.

With regard to clause 5. Duration: From a legal perspective we advise reverting the wording here to the template or providing further clarity as per the comments in the attached. \n2.	Regarding changes to clause 16(d) on Executing Agency’s obligations relating to disclosing confidential information: the changes are acceptable subject to our comments at clause 50 being accepted. \n3.	Regarding clause 18: from a legal perspective we advise removing the added words ‘by the Executing Agency’ in the beginning of the second sentence, as per the comments in the attached.  \n4.	Regarding clause 39 on responsibility of the partners: from a legal perspective we advise that you please remove wording from ‘provided at all times…’ As per comments in the attached, as a UN agency, we cannot accept a limitation on liability. \n5.	Regarding clause 41 on Publication, acknowledgements, logos and emblems: From a legal perspective the changes are not advised as they significantly reduce UNEP’s control of the content of potential publications and arrangements for publication. Please see comments in the attached and ensure that the Task Manager and the comms division has reviewed and cleared this clause before going forward with changes if the template wording is note maintained.  In addition, is it advised that the new subparagraph (b) is amended for clarity as per the suggestions in the attached. \n6.	Please confirm in clause 45 whether UNEP will receive 5 copies of the published work or electronic material. It is currently unclear. \n7.	Regarding clause 48 on IP: Please make clarifications as per the comments in the attached. \n8.	Regarding clause 50 on Confidentiality: As a UN agency, UNEP cannot be subject to national laws of any jurisdiction, hence the deletion of ‘or is required by law or by any legal or regulatory authority’ \n9.	Changes to clause 56 are not advised from a legal perspective as this takes away the right of UNEP to unilaterally decide to terminate where the cause for suspension is not rectified. Suggestion of wording is made if you wish to include a consultative process with the EA on who the new EA will be.\n10.	Please ensure that references to UNEP are consistently ‘UNEP’ and not ‘UN Environment’ as the organization is defined as UNEP in the preamble. \n11.

From a legal perspective is is not acceptable to remove the wording \'the United Nations and UNEP, their\' from Article 12(2). The rationale for the indemnity clause is that UNEP is a UN entity, and as such is immune from jurisdiction as part of its privileges and immunities. UNEP cannot delete the wording because that would imply that UNEP is waiving its privileges and immunities. Only the UN Secretary General can waive UN privileges and immunities and only in very specific and limited cases. Since this clause derives from UNEP’s status as a UN entity, it cannot be made reciprocal to Partners either. Just to clarify further, the indemnity clause does not mean that UNEP’s partner shall take all the responsibility or represent UNEP in court --- UNEP cannot be taken to court as it is immune from jurisdiction. The clause only entails that in case there were third parties raising claims against UNEP, UNEP would communicate such claim to the Partner and the Partner would be responsible for conveying the information about UNEP’s immunity from jurisdiction, to the court where actions may have been instituted. Immunity from jurisdiction is part of the immunities recognized to the UN in the 1946 Convention on the Privileges and Immunities of the UN. Hope that helps, please let us know if the Partner continues to push back and we can explore further. All the best, Neda.

We understand that you are concerned there is risk SymbioSeas will not be able to fully deliver on a contract with the UN for which only a portion of project costs are covered up-front. We wish to share with you that we are certain we can deliver on contracts with the UN, or any other grantor/funder, for which only a portion of project costs are covered up-front. Our teams are comprised of experts that work at Universities or other non-profits or consultancies. All team members receive base salaries from other employers. All projects led by SymbioSeas are set up with co-financing. For example, for the upcoming SSFA planned with the UN Environment Coral Reef Unit, team members include research scientists from the University of Miami (Ruben van Hooidonk) and from Bangor University (Gareth Williams), both of which are research scientists (Assistant Professor level). Further, for the upcoming SSFA, co-financing is being provided by NOAA. Over the last ~10 years, teams led by Jeff Maynard of SymbioSeas have delivered on ~100 grants and contracts for which only a portion of project costs were covered up-front - all of these projects led to the successful delivery and publication of technical reports or journal articles (see www.symbioseas.org for many examples). Our teams have never failed to deliver on any contract, grant or funding agreement, and always deliver high-impact reports and publications. \n\nSymbioSeas is a small organization that has a part-time accountant that assists with generating financial reports. SymbioSeas is committed to adhering to any and all standards (or \'checks and balances) the UN would like to place in SSFAs or other funding agreements to ensure transparency in accounting. We have written brief responses to the concerns you raised. \n\n•	The explanation provided about the $60K discrepancies indicates carelessness about producing factual financial reports. It is also obvious that the entity does not follow the accrual accounting principles, as they do not reflect (in their 2018 balance sheets), the receivables and future income of the $60K for 2019 from WWF, nor do they include the $20K the receivables and 2019 income from their UN 2018-2019 contract with ROAP.\n\nAs above, SymbioSeas intends to and will adhere to any checks and balances or accounting principles standards the UN recommends or requires in an SSFA or other funding agreement.\n\n•	They also provided some details of their 2018 expenses, which included the $40K they received from their UN 2018-2019 contract with ROAP. I compared these details with the financial report they submitted to ROAP for the $60K contract (ref PO 2700012806), and noted that the partner only reported to ROAP the full $60K as staff costs, while the additional details provided to us showed that some of ROAP income was used to fund their office and utilities costs. This indicates their lack of transparencies to the UN in their financial reporting.\n\nWe always intend to be transparent with our funders in our financial reporting. The concern above relates to internal allocation of funds. For many of our funders, staff costs are reported as salaries but have a percentage as overheads we then use for office space and utilities. Depending on the funder, we might report staff salaries with overheads included or excluded. We will keep this in mind and ensure reporting to the UN separates staff and \'overhead costs\' between salaries and our overhead categories. \n\n•	I also noted that the entity founders do not seem to put their own capital resources into the entity. As shown in their statements and confirmed by the entity, their initial start-up income was $75K cash received from a 2016 grant from NOAA. This indicates lack of sustainability as a going concern, as the entity is entirely dependent on the grants from their partners.\n\nOur organization is small, but is perennially funded by the NOAA Coral Reef Conservation Program. We did not initially put capital resources into the entity but did not need to, as we were in a small office at the time supported through Cornell University, where Jeff Maynard held a position. Projects led by SymbioSeas as the applicant organization are led by teams of experts, all of whom work part-time on the projects and have ongoing support from universities or other conservation organizations. Sustainability of the entity is not a concern due to the small size of the organization and that Director Jeff Maynard and the part-time research assistants and accountant all have other ongoing funding for salaries (which match or serve as co-financing for many funded projects). \n \n•	While the entity reported full expenses of 2018 income ($191,477), it seemed that they have not spent their 2016-2017 income from NOAA, the Nature Conservancy and WWF. I am not sure why they prioritized their 2018 contracts over their older ones, and this raises concerns about their accountability to their partners who must have been waiting for the results of their 2016-2017 contracts.\n\nFunds are expended for projects as needed. Some of our longer-term projects funded in 2016 and 2017 were delivered on in 2019 rather than 2018, with delays due to waiting for climate model data to become available. There are no partners of SymbioSeas projects waiting on results from 2016-2017 contracts; these have been delivered on in 2019 or are ongoing and will be delivered on in 2019 and 2020. \n\n•	In March 2019, the partner reported to UNEP ROAP full expenses of $60K even though they only received $40K from ROAP.  Based on the information provided by the entity, it could be concluded that they pre-financed the $20K for UNEP ROAP contract implementation in 2019 from unspent cash received from their other partners prior to 2018. This also raises more concerns about their accountability to their partners.\n\nThis is incorrect - as explained in the intro paragraph, all contracts and grant agreements led by SymbioSeas required completing projects for which only a portion of the funds were covered up-front. Our own capital is then used to finance the rest of the project to completion and then funders reimburse with their final payment. It is our own capital rather than cash received from other partners that is used to close projects and then we are reimbursed with the final project payment. \n',2656,'2019-09-30 09:05:50',NULL,NULL,0),(1732,1607,2078,0,NULL,2,'AgreementSummary','agreements','I\'ve revised as per advised email.',2116,'2019-09-30 10:42:23',NULL,NULL,0),(1733,1607,2078,0,NULL,2,'AgreementSummary','agreements','I\'ve revised as per advised email.',2116,'2019-09-30 10:42:30',NULL,NULL,0),(1734,1822,1865,NULL,NULL,2,'AgreementSummary','agreements','Annex I, Implementation Plan: dates needs to be adjusted to realistic dates under Activity 1- Strengthening the RAC Association (1 September 2019) and Activity 3 – Coordinating, organizing and implementing training of Customs and law enforcement agents and refrigeration technicians (1 October 2019).

Under the 1995 Mekong Agreement the Article 3 on Protection of the Environment and Ecological Balance and within the MRC Secretariat, the Environmental Management Division leads the MRC work in environmental planning, assessment, monitoring and reporting, including water quality issues in the Mekong basin. The MRC works with many different partners through Memoranda of Understanding and jointly funded activities including research and mutual exchanges and learnings. At MRC, Water Quality Monitoring, since its inception in 1985 has been one of the key environmental monitoring activities and has provided a continuous record of water quality in the Mekong River and its tributaries. The routine water quality monitoring under the WQMN has become one of the key environmental monitoring activities at MRC. The Procedures for Water Quality (PWQ), one of the five Procedures of the MRC for basin management, establish a cooperative framework for the maintenance of acceptable/good water quality to promote the sustainable development of the Mekong River Basin.;\" \n\n\nParagraph 2 speaks of UNEP and Paragraph 4 of UNEP and MRC.

This clearance is attached as one of the documents in the partnership portal as an indication of the approval of the partner.\n\nMy first thought while reviewing the partnership was to indicate the reputational issues associated with the partnership. However, since the partner had been previously approved, I will indicate the following in the portal:\n\n1.	Since the partner is already approved and engaged with UNEP through legal instruments my understanding is that the request to the Partnership Committee is to allow the partner to be included in the portal and the Partnership Committee is in a position to decide whether or not the partner should be approved as it is already approved;\n2.	My understanding is that additional funds have to be received by this partner and the purpose of the request to the Partnership Committee was to input the partner in the system so that the partnership portal is updated and not necessarily for our review;\n3.	I requested clarification on whether thus far any reputational issues had come up regarding the reputational risks associated with the partner. Furthermore, I wanted to know if the partner is fulfilling their obligation towards UNEP, financial or otherwise. In view of this, I requested to see the previous agreements with the partner which I am now sharing with you. Not for the purpose of review but to indicate that the partner has already been engaged by UNEP and therefore a review at this moment is a formality. \n\nI would suggest that the submitting office should indicate in the comments  in the system information on the dealings with the partner to respond to the concerns in point 3 above (@Francis Njoroge could you kindly ask the submitting office to provide some information on this in the portal). Also as suggested above, these pre-existing legal instruments should be updated under the partner for ease of reference for other staff members. \n\nMy approach therefore is to indicate in the portal that I have no comment regarding this partner and that my endorsement is given only based on the premise that the partner has already been approved by the previous ED. Additionally since the partner is already engaged by UNEP through pre-existing legal instruments (which the need to be added as part of the document under this partner for ease of reference by anyone using the portal) as a member of the PC I cannot comment regarding this partner. \n\nRegards \n',2125,'2019-12-10 08:11:31',NULL,NULL,0),(2106,1586,NULL,NULL,NULL,1,'AssesmentQuestions','partners','Please see the comment above.',28,'2019-12-10 09:21:26',NULL,NULL,0),(2107,1586,NULL,NULL,NULL,1,'Comments','partners','I\'m sorry but I don\'t understand what \"how the partner will be engaged\" refers to.

Some of the OGCI companies (BP, Equinor, Eni, Repsol, Shell, Total) are also part to another multi-stakeholder initiative implemented by the Energy and Climate Branch: the Oil and Gas Methane Partnership. This due diligence process is in relation to the Methane Science Studies, and the original donor agreement and the governing framework for the Methane Science Studies are attached as support documents. To date, OGCI has donated $6M to UNEP for the Methane Science Studies. More details on the Methane Science Studies workstream and individual studies are included in the attached CCAC Methane Science Studies brief. The original partnership and donations were approved by the executive director at the time (please see attached MoUs_CCAC_Methane Studies_Partnership clearance). We are currently seeking approval to update the donor agreement to accept an additional $885,000 from OGCI.\n \nThe companies of OGCI have numerous responsibilities towards the Methane Science Studies, which are detailed in the Methane Science Studies Framework and Donor Agreement, both of which are attached. First, in the context of the Methane Science Studies, the payments have been made in a timely fashion. Secondly, the framework of the Methane Science Studies lists a number of obligations with respect to the OGCI companies with respect to: attending and contributing to Steering Committee meetings, attending and contributing to Technical Working Group meetings, facilitating permissions and conversations with government representatives, sharing data, and generally ensuring that the studies are grounded in an understanding of how oil and gas systems operate.\n \nIn the working relationship to date, there have been no reputational impacts to UNEP through our collaboration with OGCI companies. The UNEP staff which participate in the Methane Science Studies, as well as staff which participate in other collaborative projects with OGCI, regularly attend international meetings and conferences to present on the topic of methane. There has been no evidence of reputational damage at these conferences. Additionally, internet searching reveals no articles or other results that state that the Methane Science Studies or the Oil and Gas Methane Partnership are greenwashing.\n',2289,'2019-12-10 21:53:43',NULL,NULL,0),(2112,445,987,754,NULL,2,'AgreementSummary','agreements',', please check that the funds related to NW18 in this SSFA have been offset.

On the one hand, the report acknowledges that “Tens of millions of people worldwide depend on artisanal and small-scale mining (ASM) for their livelihoods and incomes, far more than depend on large-scale mining (LSM).”41 Yet, on the other hand, the report opts to “focus on large-scale mining” and only discusses ASM “when it directly relates to LSM.” This is a crucial oversight because it paints an inaccurate picture of the role ASM can play developmentally in the world’s resource-rich but poor countries and, in the process, how its growth can help address the SDGs. However, the Atlas is correct in stating that “The scale of ASM warrants a separate guide and review to map the opportunities on how ASM can contribute to the SDGs.” Small-scale mining is extremely detrimental of the environment and of the social conditions of people directly and indirectly involved in the business. The window for UNEP to influence environmental and social improvements in this sector are very challenging, complex and costly. I believe, the partnership with Anexpo in Colombia might give UNEP the opportunity to introduce changes which are beneficial to the environment and concerned people (especially women). In principle, I do support the partnership with Anexpo subject to a risk management plan with particular attention to the branding aspect of the partnership and a close follow-up of the development and outcome of the concrete partnership However, I suggest a call with the UNEP Office in Colombia to learn more about the basis, objectives and scope of the partnership.

Other local community organizations were also evaluated, but they did not comply with UNEP´s legal, financial and technical requirements to manage the scale of this project and to be able to pass a due diligences process. Signing the SSFA directly with the Ministry of Environment in the Dominican Republic, was an evaluated option, but this government institution preferred not to manage the project because they could not directly receive and administrate the funds. However, the Ministry of Environment in the Dominican Republic has provided good work references from FUCATEBA, and expressed their interest in continuing supporting its work in the area of intervention.

The membership is comprised of states, governmental agencies, international governmental organizations and national non-governmental organizations. IUCN is registered in Gland, Switzerland as an international association of governmental and non-governmental members under article 60 of the Swiss Civil Code. IUCN Centre for Mediterranean Cooperation is a delegation in Spain of IUCN, and as such is registered before the Spanish Ministry of Interior, as the  certificate of registry (Certificación Registral) (see attachment) accredits together with the tax identification card  (Tarjeta de Indentificación Fiscal)  (see attachment); \n\n(2)	As a delegation in Spain of IUCN, the IUCN-Centre for Mediterranean Cooperation  follows the nature of  IUCN, i.e. an organization the memberships is comprised of states, governmental agencies and governmental and non-governmental organizations. The list of  Mediterranean Members  of IUCN-Centre for Mediterranean Cooperation (https://www.iucn.org/regions/mediterranean/about/mediterranean-members ) reflects this aspect, with most of the Ministries of either Environment or Foreign Affairs of the Contracting Parties to the Barcelona Convention being members of the IUCN-  Centre for Mediterranean Cooperation. This government-membership feature takes particular relevance in Spain. The  Spanish Ministry of Environment as well as several regional governments form part of the  IUCN- Centre for Mediterranean Cooperation. This adds to the fact that the IUCN-Centre for Mediterranean Cooperation was established within the framework of a MOU among the IUCN, the Spanish Ministry of Environment, the Spanish Agency for International Cooperation of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the Regional Government of Andalusia. This is pointed out in page 7 of  the audit report of the IUCN Centre for the Mediterranean Cooperation (Informe the Auditoria del Centro the Cooperación del Mediterráneo de la Unión Internacional para la Conservación de la Naturaleza). \n\nAll the documents attached are already in the Partnership Portal.

The meeting took the view that the Centre would be established and would operate as a national institution with a regional role to play, like the Regional Activity Centres already in operation as part of MAP. (Source: UNEP/IG. 56/INF. 8-See attachment);\n(3)	As the 1991 Agreement between the Government of Tunisia and UNEP as amended  states in its preamble (see attachment), RAC/SPA was established in 1985 as a national center with a regional role, through which the Government of Tunisia contributed to the Mediterranean Action Plan (MAP).  The Agreement further emphasizes this point in its operative paragraph 1, by providing that RAC/SPA will be managed and operated under the control of the Ministry of Environment  as a Tunisian national institution with a regional role as recognized and defined by the Contracting Parties to the Barcelona Convention; \n(4)	Consequently with the nature so defined, COP Decision IG. 19/5, adopted by the 16th Meeting of the Contracting Parties to the Barcelona Convention (Marrakech, 3-5 November 2009) (see attachment), defines  the regional role of RAC/SPA in assisting countries to implement the 1982 Protocol concerning Specially Protected Areas in the Mediterranean, amended by the  1995 Protocol concerning Specially Protected Areas and Biological Diversity in the Mediterranean (the “SPA/Biodiversity Protocol”). More specifically, the role of  RAC/SPA is to provide assistance to the Contracting Parties in meeting their obligations under Articles 4 and 10 of the Barcelona Convention, 1995, and under SPA/BD Protocol; as well as in implementing the Strategic Action Programme for the Conservation of Biological Biodiversity in the Mediterranean Region (SAP BIO), adopted by the Contracting Parties in 2003, and the Mediterranean Strategy for Sustainable Development. \n(5)	Under the previous PCA between UNEP and RAC/SPA (See attachment), RAC/SPA was defined as a non-profit oriented and non-partisan organization. The former PCA was signed by the Director of the RAC/SPA, which is a a clear sign of RAC/SPA having its own legal personality.',17,'2020-02-28 11:34:14',NULL,NULL,0),(2368,273,NULL,NULL,NULL,1,'Documents','partners','Email from Maria Luisa Rodriguez Lucas, Legal Officer with MAP, dated 27 February 2020:\n\nThis email refers to the key documents supporting the change in status in the Partners Portal as regards the Priority Actions Programme /Regional Activity Centre (PAP/RAC) from “NGOs” to “Government/Governmental”. Documents attached will be uploaded in the Portal from our side by today.   \n\n(1)	1996 Agreement between the Republic of Croatia and UNEP concerning PAP/RAC (see attachment). The Agreement lists in its preamble the steps which led to the establishment of PAP/RAC by the Government of the former Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (SFRY) as a national centre with a regional role. The point of departure is the decision of the Contracting Parties to the Barcelona Convention at their intergovernmental meeting of on the Blue Plan (Split 1977) to accept the offer by the former SFRY to host a regional center in Split relevant to a Priority Actions Programme.  On that basis,  the Government of SFRY adopted a decree announcing the establishment of  PAP/RAC.  The operative part of the Agreement reflects well the nature of the centre as defined in the preamble, by pointed out that the centre, as a Croatian institute,  shall act pursuant the decision of the Contracting Parties to the Barcelona Convention as a RAC entrusted with the implementation of the  Priority Actions Programme, as part of the MAP. \n\n(2)	COP Decision IG. 19/5, adopted by the 16th Meeting of the Contracting Parties to the Barcelona Convention (Marrakech, 3-5 November 2009) (see attachment). Decision IG. 19/5 details  the regional role of PAP/SPA in  providing assistance to Mediterranean countries in the implementation of the Barcelona Convention, the Integrated Coastal Zone Management Protocol as well as the  Mediterranean Strategy for Sustainable Development. \n\n(3)	PCA between UNEP and PAP/RAC (see attachment). Under the previous PCA between UNEP and PAP/RAC , PAP/RAC was defined as a non-profit oriented and non-partisan organization.

I have reviewed the certificate of incorporation of the partner and the purpose of the corporation is to own and manage a pay television network that will acquire, create or produce films, tapes and other video materials for transmission and distribution via satellite or otherwise, to pay television system operators in the United States or worldwide amongst others. What is the nature of the engagement of the partner? 2. The name of the partner was changed from Discovery Communications, Inc to Discovery Communications, LLC as of 4 May 2007. However, subsequently, the partner still used the name Discovery Communcations, LLC as of 28 April 2008.

These delays are affecting project delivery. The Government recently announced that they have now completed the D-Fund registration (new system of consolidating official development assistance with the Ministry of Finance). Despite this positive development, the delays are unlikely to be sorted as there are complementary risks related to current practices in decision making and delegation of authority. At the moment, all decisions concerning payments above Tzh 3 million (US$1,300) go to the Permanent Secretary or OIC, including authorizing payments of consultants. There are also informal complaints by international consulting firms on communications and transacting with VPO. These issues are related to payments that are delayed by several months, withholding taxes that were not reflected in contracts, and currency issues. These are still in the process of being resolved though and no conclusions on any wrongdoing have been made. There have also been delays and challenges for VPO to establish effective MOUs with other Government agencies charged with implementation activities on the ground, resulting in implementation progressing very slowly and mainly at the central level. It will be therefore critical to closely monitoring these risks to ensure that this GEF child project can be implemented in a timely fashion under these regulations. This is because this project is part of a global GEF program, with another 10 country child projects running in parallel. An early MTR will be considered to assess whether adequate progress is being made under the PCA arrangements.',1103,'2020-10-06 18:30:05',NULL,NULL,0),(3131,2205,3102,0,NULL,2,'PreAssessment','agreements','Dear Charuwan,\nThanks for your clarifications below, all fine with me.\nI will return to you.\nBest.\nIsabel\n\nFrom: Charuwan Tintukasiri  \nSent: Wednesday, October 07, 2020 6:35 AM\nTo: Isabel Martinez \nCc: Shaofeng Hu ; Pipat Poopeerasupong ; Kherlenzaya Ariunbold \nSubject: RE: Legal Review of 2020-UN2UN_AFG/PHA/85/TAS/27 HCFC Phase-out Management Plan (stage I, fourth tranche) in Afghanistan (A3102)\n\nDear Ms. Isabel,\nThank you so much for your kind review.

Therefore, it is correct to delete the reference to such Annex. Normally the reference to annexes or listing of annexes is made in section A. SUMMARY OF ACTIVITIES, Annexes.\n\nPlease find below some other comments:\n\n1.	A -Summary of activities, start/end date: It is advisable that the end date of activities is prior to the date of submission of the final financial report and overall conclusion of the agreement. Normally it is necessary some time to finalize the finances of the agreements after the programmatic activities have concluded. In this connection you may wish to set up the end of activities date by the 30th of November 2021 or a bit earlier rather than 31st of December 2021. Since the activities will be finished by the National Ozone Unit by 31st December 2021, I will then put the end date to be one month after, i.e. 31 January 2022.\n\n2.	A -Summary of activities, Annexes A and B: Annexes A and B are mentioned under Expected Outcome and at the end of section A. Normally Annexes include their names (e.g. Annex A -project, implementation plan or Annex B-budget, etc). For ease of reference see print screen below. At least the name of the annexes should be mentioned and added to the UN to UN agreement.  I will add the name of annexes as suggested.\n\n \n\n \n\n3.	The following table is unclear:\n \nWhat does the due date mean in this agreement? End of activities? End of the agreement? Normally the end date of activities is prior to the overall end date of the agreement. Kindly clarify.  The due date here mean end of activities.\n\n4.	Section D-Reporting, Narrative Reporting: \n\nThe agreement says “The Recipient Agency will provide the Contributing Agency with a narrative report on the progress of the Activities on a regular basis, as set out below.” \n\nI don’t seem to see the schedule for the narrative reports. I will add as below:\n1.	Submission of annual progress report with expenditure statement by 31st January 2021\n2.

This amount, hereinafter referred to as the “coordination levy” will be held in trust by UNEP until transfer to the United Nations Secretariat for deposit into the United Nations Special Purpose Trust Fund for the reinvigorated Resident Coordinator system, which has been established to fund the UN Resident Coordinator System and is managed by the United Nations Secretariat. \n\nThe Donor acknowledges that once the coordination levy has been transferred by UNEP to the United Nations Secretariat, UNEP is not responsible for the use of the coordination levy and does not assume any liability. The fiduciary responsibility lies with the United Nations Secretariat as the manager of the Resident Coordinator system. \n\nThe coordination levy does not form part of UNEP’s cost recovery and is additional to the costs of UNEP to implement the activity or activities covered by the contribution. Accordingly, there is no normal obligation for UNEP to refund the levy, in part or in full, even where the activities covered by the contribution are not carried out in full by UNEP. As deemed necessary by the donor- and especially where the scale of the resources concerned or reputational risk justify the refund transaction costs – the donor can submit a request for refund to the United nations Secretariat directly or through the United Nations entity. The responsibility to refund the levy lies with the United Nations Secretariat, and not with the concerned entity of the United Nations. \n\nThe coordination levy for this agreement is $9,408.

As part of this agreement, POLIMI is supporting the development of Green Climate Fund project proposal for Green Neighbourhoods in Beirut. The project will put in place financial mechanisms to support the uptake of energy efficient and sustainable energy systems. It also aims to ensure the sustainability of the market by strengthening the capacity of local stakeholders.\n\nSpecifically, POLIMI will first support the development of the market assessment needed for this project. For this assessment, POLIMI will prepare an analysis of demand for Beirut and other major cities in Lebanon to determine the market size, then prepare a baseline report (a buildings stock analysis from the energy point of view, an assessment of the energy needs and use and CO2 emissions of the building stock, and GHG emissions savings potential) and subsequently identify potential technological solutions and their climate benefits. Once the market assessment is complete, POLIMI will support the development of a programme strategy and a monitoring and evaluation plan for the programme as per the Green Climate Fund Guidelines, as well as reviewing the full funding proposal before its eventual submission to the GCF Secretariat.\n\nAn indicative budget and implementation plan is included as an annex to the agreement document in the portal, attaching here as well. Please do let Myriem and I know if there are any other clarifications needed for the PRC process.\n\nBest,\nAarth\n\n',2079,'2020-12-10 18:59:08',NULL,NULL,0),(3458,559,NULL,NULL,NULL,1,'AssesmentQuestions','partners','Based on the above explanation, I am fine endorsing the partner.',2079,'2020-12-10 19:00:16',NULL,NULL,0),(3459,2628,3618,NULL,NULL,2,'AgreementSummary','agreements','For 2nd payment please include requirement of 70% disbarment on previous payment.

Under the questions: “How will the risks identified be monitored by UN Environment in order to ensure these issues are resolved?) in the mitigation plan the answer is:\n\nThe planetGOLD programme has a very active communication team which very regularly promotes positive stories about the project, our partners, and the sector in general. The communication team is also monitoring the media (daily) for any reports on the sector so that any issues with the projects or any of our partners would immediately be identified and proper action taken to address the issue or ensure correct reporting. The MoU is proposed for a 3-years extension which is shorter than the duration of the planetGOLD programme. Therefore, the communication team will continue monitoring any negative report for the duration of our collaboration.\n\nIt is important that the engagement with the partner should spell out very clearly UNEP’s role in monitoring the media and the implementation of the partnership itself to cater for the reputational risk.\n\n2.	We therefore suggest the following: \na.	More detailed information regarding the contribution of the partnerships to the PoW and SDGs. \nb.	Past concrete achievements. What will the focus of this renewed collaboration be (some information is on the risk mitigation plan but good be good to add it to the dd).\nc.	As to the risk mitigation plan:\n\n-	Provide concrete examples that speak to this statement “…Moreover, the refiners based in Switzerland, such as Argor, are involved in the Government-Sponsored Swiss Better Gold Initiative through which a portion of their gold is used to develop social and environmental programmes in the countries of origin.”\nd.	Clarify UNEP’s role in terms of monitoring risks, in particularly, potential reputational risks.\n\n\n',2125,'2021-02-12 17:47:27',NULL,NULL,0),(3640,1944,NULL,NULL,NULL,1,'AssesmentQuestions','partners','Kindly advise as to the nature of the engagement of the partner and how the engagement will contribute towards UNEP\'s work.',2125,'2021-02-12 17:56:45',NULL,NULL,0),(3641,445,3619,0,NULL,2,'AgreementSummary','agreements','Submitting SSFA with GRID - Arendal for review',463,'2021-02-14 15:47:59',NULL,NULL,0),(3642,1482,3776,NULL,NULL,2,'AgreementSummary','agreements',' (Quality Assurance)',2161,'2021-02-15 14:34:47',NULL,NULL,0),(3643,1944,NULL,NULL,NULL,1,'Comments','partners','Akvo will support UNEP through the SSFA to meet several requests in UNEA resolutions which are incorporated into the PoW of UNEP - going forward the focus is on the development of a digital platform in response to UNEA 4/6 para 3 building on existing initiatives, the Global Partnership on Marine Litter (UNEP was requested to strengthen its input to the GPML in resolution 3/7 para 7).

This MOU with the French Region Anjou will support the development of a sustainable tourism strategy in the region that will be based on the Green Passport principles. Since 2008, UN Environment and its destination partners (14 in total) have produced Green Passport travel guides in more than 10 countries. The Green Passport was also one of UN Environment flagship initiatives during RIO+20, South African and Brazilian World Cups and Brazilian Olympic Games, engaging in total resources around USD 10 M in project activities. We are also discussing with Airbnb and International Olympic Committee a campaign for Tokyo 2021. However, outside the scope of large events, UNEP’s tourism programme has limited funds to implement the Campaign and to promote demand for sustainable tourism products and services. In this sense, UNEP partners with tourism destinations, NGO’s and private sector partners that are willing to finance their own implementation of the Green Passport campaign aligned to our advice and criteria. By signing this agreement this organisation can align their tourism strategic planning with financial mechanisms to support the implementation of these campaigns, and align with the French recovery plans on tourism, and we can ensure sustainable tourism actions are included in their regional policies. The  Comité Départemental du Tourisme de l’Anjou  will engage in the Campaign the private sector and local communities in order to implement a model of sustainable tourism that would support economic growth and insure protection of cultural and natural heritage of the Region. UNEP will also take advantage of this engagement to bring private sectors in the region to support voluntary initiatives to mainstream SCP and combat pollution such as the global tourism plastics initiative. Considering the governmental status of the region, a due diligence is not required. As the online portal agreements do not cater for French versions, it was suggested to upload a pdf version of the word document once MOU is signed. The end date of the signature is 31-12-2025.

The due diligence process should provide more elements on the links between the company and the oil, gas and mining sector, and whether TSC has been involved in building some sort of environmental image for clients in this sector (the memo published on cooperation with the hydrocarbon sector could be of help here). 2) It is unclear what is the level of risk for this partner: the Risk Assessment above mentions that RepRisk evaluates TSC as a low-risk entity. The strategy risk assessment provides that a potential partnership with TSC represents a medium reputational risk. But in the Partners Portal, the partner is rated as critical.  Why these differences? 3) Finally, we note that TSC specializes in management consultancy services, corporate strategy and communications advisory and consulting services, software and programming activities, and software and database development services. We further note that there an MOU in preparation with TSC. What is the purpose of the partnership and the of the MOU? As TSC is a private sector partner, the MOU cannot be used for the provision of goods or services to UNEP. This should go through a normal procurement process.

Under Article 6, we observed that you have changed the original wordings of the Article and used the term will instead of shall.

Under Article 10, we recommend the following rewording ‘This Memorandum of Understanding shall have an initial term of two years from the last date of signature of the approving officials unless terminated earlier by mutual consent or by either Party upon three months’ notice in writing to the other Party. This Memorandum of Understanding may be amended only by mutual written agreement of the Parties.

This amount, hereinafter referred to as the “coordination levy” will be held in trust by UNEP until transfer to the United Nations Secretariat for deposit into the United Nations Special Purpose Trust Fund for the reinvigorated Resident Coordinator system, which has been established to fund the UN Resident Coordinator System and is managed by the United Nations Secretariat. The Donor acknowledges that once the coordination levy has been transferred by UNEP to the United Nations Secretariat, UNEP is not responsible for the use of the coordination levy and does not assume any liability. The fiduciary responsibility lies with the United Nations Secretariat as the manager of the Resident Coordinator system. The coordination levy does not form part of UNEP’s cost recovery and is additional to the costs of UNEP to implement the activity or activities covered by the contribution. Accordingly, there is no normal obligation for UNEP to refund the levy, in part or in full, even where the activities covered by the contribution are not carried out in full by UNEP. As deemed necessary by the donor- and especially where the scale of the resources concerned or reputational risk justify the refund transaction costs – the donor can submit a request for refund to the United nations Secretariat directly or through the United Nations entity. The responsibility to refund the levy lies with the United Nations Secretariat, and not with the concerned entity of the United Nations. The coordination levy for this agreement is $9,685.23.

Areas of Cooperation:- UNEP and TSC have agreed to enter into a partnership relationship to build a Pilot for the “Connect Stakeholders” component of the Global Partnership on Marine Litter (GPML) Digital Platform.\n',793,'2021-06-07 15:46:41',NULL,NULL,0),(4009,2776,4169,0,NULL,2,'AgreementSummary','agreements','After reviewing the draft MOU from the legal standpoint, our comments are as follows:\n1.	Under Article 2 on Areas of Cooperation, we would suggest adding the following text to the last bullet point as follows: ‘Amplify both parties\' communications messaging and collaborate on mutually beneficial materials such as social media posts, blogs, and newsletters, within the scope of the Parties’ respective regulatory framework.’\n2.	Under Article 3 Paragraph (1), the sentence is incomplete. Kindly revise this section.\n3.	Under Article 9 Paragraph (1), we observed that you have deleted the section on non-authorization of use of UNEP/UN name and emblem for commercial purposes. We note that the partner is not-for-profit however we cannot authorize the use of the organisation name and logo for commercial purposes, and we need to have it stated in the agreement thus revise Paragraph (1) to read as below:\n‘Neither Party shall use the name, emblem or trademarks of the other Party, its subsidiaries and/or affiliates, or any abbreviation thereof, in connection with its business or for public dissemination without the prior expressly written approval of the other Party in each case. In no event shall authorization of the UN or UNEP name or emblem be granted for commercial purposes.’\n4.	Under Article 12 on responsibility, we note that Paragraph (2) of the template has been deleted. Please consider that this is a boilerplate provision for us, and we CANNOT accept ANY changes to this provision. Therefore, include the following paragraph: \nASU shall indemnify, hold and save harmless and defend at its own expense, the United Nations and UNEP, their officials, personnel and representatives, from and against all suits, claims, demands and liability of any nature or kind which may arise in relation to this MOU due to any actions or omissions attributable to ASU.\n5.	Under Article 13 on Dispute Settlement, we note that our standard Dispute Settlement has been deleted. While the proposed provision has a reference on settle disputes amicably, we cannot accept the proposed provisions as it refers to non-binding arbitration in accordance with applicable laws and court rules. Please consider that due to UNEP’s legal status, we CANNOT be subject to any national legislation as acceptance of such a provision would imply UNEP’s waiver to the UN Privileges and Immunities which we are not authorized to do. Thus, we would suggest retaining the original text on alternate dispute settlements through arbitration in accordance with UNCITRAL Arbitration. In addition, Article VIII, Section 29 of the Convention on the Privileges and Immunities of the United Nations provides that, “the United Nations shall make provisions for appropriate modes of settlement of (a) disputes arising out of contracts or other disputes of a private law character to which the United Nations is a party; (b) disputes involving any official of the United Nations who by reason of his official position enjoys immunity, if immunity has not been waived by the Secretary-General.” This provision is the basis for the arbitration and dispute resolution clauses set forth in all United Nations (and UNEP) contracts. Although the United Nations does not agree to waive its privileges and immunities in its contracts, by agreeing to arbitrate disputes of a private law character as a full and final resolution thereof, such as disputes arising out of contracts, the United Nations is providing for an “appropriate mode of settlement” of such dispute. Thus, such a dispute resolution mechanism fulfills the Organization’s requirements under Section 29 of the Convention to provide an appropriate mode of settlement of disputes arising out of contracts to which the United Nations (in this case UNEP) is a party.\n6.

This amount, hereinafter referred to as the “coordination levy” will be held in trust by UNEP until transfer to the United Nations Secretariat for deposit into the United Nations Special Purpose Trust Fund for the reinvigorated Resident Coordinator system, which has been established to fund the UN Resident Coordinator System and is managed by the United Nations Secretariat. The Donor acknowledges that once the coordination levy has been transferred by UNEP to the United Nations Secretariat, UNEP is not responsible for the use of the coordination levy and does not assume any liability. The fiduciary responsibility lies with the United Nations Secretariat as the manager of the Resident Coordinator system. The coordination levy does not form part of UNEP’s cost recovery and is additional to the costs of UNEP to implement the activity or activities covered by the contribution. Accordingly, there is no normal obligation for UNEP to refund the levy, in part or in full, even where the activities covered by the contribution are not carried out in full by UNEP. As deemed necessary by the donor- and especially where the scale of the resources concerned or reputational risk justify the refund transaction costs – the donor can submit a request for refund to the United nations Secretariat directly or through the United Nations entity. The responsibility to refund the levy lies with the United Nations Secretariat, and not with the concerned entity of the United Nations. The coordination levy for this agreement is $4,792. The amounts indicated on the payment schedule, refer to article I, includes the appropriate portion of the disbursements of the coordination levy and the payments of the contribution. “\n3.

However, the information provided in answer to our comment reveals that the status of the lawsuit is as follows. On 7 November 2019, the Paris Court of Appeals upheld the indictment of the company for deliberate endangerment of people’s lives, financing of terrorism and violation of an embargo. However, the court overturned the indictment for complicity in crimes against humanity committed in Syria – notably by the Islamic State. Both aspects of the appeal decision have been contested before the Cour of Cassation (the highest/supreme French judicial court). So, the Cour de Cassation will rule on whether the charges of endangerment of people’s lives, financing of terrorism and violation of an embargo should remain, and whether the charges of complicity in crimes against humanity committed in Syria should be reinstated. \nThe charges are therefore maintained at the moment and if the Cour de Cassation confirms them, Holcim AG will be prosecuted for endangerment of people’s lives, financing of terrorism and violation of an embargo (or one or two of these, and maybe with complicity of crimes against humanity added to the list). \n\nWe are not certain that the monitoring mechanism put in place to follow the development of this case is sufficient to address the risks posed by Holcim AG as these charges are extremely serious. \n\nFurthermore, although ensuring that Holcim AG does not use UNEP’s name or logo in any communication related to its activities in Syria and in Myanmar or does not develop communication that would be detrimental to UNEP is of course necessary, this does not address the question of the risks posed by the critics or claims that could be laid against UNEP by the civil parties to the lawsuit or any other organisation working on behalf of the environment or the victims of the Syrian conflict.\n\n2) With regard to the question of extractive activities, although there is indeed value in engaging with the cement and building sector to promote sustainable buildings and building processes, the fact that Holcim AG is involved in the oil and gas industry through supplying well and drilling solutions, namely via providing cement for the wells raises additional questions. \n\nFor these reasons, we would recommend discussion this partner collectively and refer the decision to the Chair of the Partnership Committee.

In their Rakuten Shopping Webs, every customer needs to register to use all the services in Rakuten Shopping Webs.

We hope this clarifies this question for the Private Sector Unit. Dear Mabrouk: could you give us your opinions? Best regards, Shunichi Honda. * The Private Sector Unit’s stance is as follows: An excerpt extracted from the UNSDG Common Approach to Prospect Research and Due Diligence for Business Sector Partnerships (https://bit.ly/3AP5aEA) lists Tobacco manufacturers under the Common Set of Exclusionary Criteria section (page 11) and elaborates as follows: \"Entities for whom the core business is the production and wholesale distribution of tobacco products\". This “exclusionary” criterion indicates that production and wholesale distribution of tobacco must be a core business focus. Rakuten is a Japanese electronic commerce and online retailing company. While Rakuten does not manufacture tobacco products, it does sell such products. Tobacco involvement/links triggers a medium risk rating on the Partners Portal (16 DD Questions). This partner has been assessed as a high-risk entity by the Private Sector Unit due to other reputational issues (e.g. labour rights violations) and a risk mitigation plan has been prepared by the partnership lead, Honda Shunichi. The plan should be updated to include that this entity profits from tobacco and how UNEP would mitigate any arising risks pertaining to this aspect. This will allow the Partnership Committee to be in a better position to review this potential partnership. We are also in agreement with Isabel’s view that this potential partnership should be piloted and assessed on an annual basis. The results and impacts of the partnership will dictate whether it should proceed or be discontinued. Ultimately, the Partnership Committee has the final judgement regarding the approval or rejection of this partner. Furthermore, specific information pertaining to this partnership is required. A concise breakdown on what the partnership will exactly entail between UNEP and Rakuten would be very helpful at this stage. The review of this potential partnership should continue and the Private Sector Unit will bilaterally seek more details from the partnership lead.

In the case of China Tianying, it went publicly listed in China\'s Shenzhen Stock Exchange through reverse takeover in 2014. The search result indicates no negative news for Tianying.\nA positive news for Tianying, released by China Environment News (a national newspaper running on working days, based in Beijing), July 22, 2021, is that Tianying is among the top 3 environment protection enterprises in China, which is available at  https://www.cenews.com.cn/newpos/202107/t20210722_978727.html\nFocal point of Tianying for us confirmed from its HQ that no record of warnings or punishments by Chinese government authorities.  \nI incorporated these points into our assessment, but please let me know if there are additional questions I can address. \nKind regards,\nSarah\nFrom: Daniel Cooney  \nSent: Thursday, October 14, 2021 10:17 AM\nTo: Sarah Bons ; Andrina Beaumond (Affiliate) \nCc: Atif Ikram Butt ; Ruihe Tu ; Qi Qin ; Atif Ikram Butt ; Alejandra Perez ; Sonja Leighton-Kone ; Alexander Juras ; Thomas Didier Paul Deleuil ; Isabel Martinez \nSubject: Re: Champion of the Earth Award - question on selection process\nDear Sarah,\nI am better placed to answer this. \nHere is my response (as Director of the Communication Division, and not as a member of the Partnership Committee):\n“If the Partnership Committee approves this partnership, the next step would be for the Communication Division, together with the Asia-Pacific office (the lead on this proposed partnership), to develop a detailed sponsorship plan with the company for Champions of the Earth.

A member of our Partnership Committee asked the following question:\nKindly provide information how it will be ensured that the sponsor will not influence the Champion of the Earth selection process, e.g. if there is a candidate that would not get endorsement from the Chinese Government. Will UNEP be able to operate freely and without undue influence if we accepted this support?\n\nIt was suggested I reach out to you to get more information on the selection process. Could you kindly address the below questions:\nFrom the perspective of procedures/process of selection, is there any possibility for the sponsor to influence formally or informally?  Is there any step to consult the sponsor?  Is there any step to consult the government of the concerned member state? Is there any step to consult the government of the awardee’s nationality? To our best knowledge and based on experiences in the last a few years, the selection process is handled by only a few staff and is kept it in a secret till open announcement. \nMany thanks in advance!\nKind regards,\nSarah',3197,'2021-10-20 14:24:22',NULL,NULL,0),(4640,2188,4518,NULL,NULL,2,'AgreementSummary','agreements','Given the ongoing discussions in relation to the regional consultations and the inclusion of 6 regional consultations in this agreement, I am doubtful we would be able to undertake all of them before April 2022 (concluding date of this agreement).

And IETC has also been consulting our possible collaboration with our Division Director, and her latest comments were: “It is good to see that Rakuten is part of RE100.  Our partnership with them should be to see if they are interested to work with us on a strategy for how its e-commerce could promote consumer information”. Also she mentioned “UNEP needs to collaborate with them to creating positive impact for addressing the climate, nature and pollution crises”. Based on her comments, IETC will continue further exploring strategic collaboration with them and also continue consulting internally. Furthermore, the following text was added in Risk Mitigation Plan: UNEP IETC will regularly check any of their possible risk with the items which were identified as risk during the Due Diligence process. The items include selling tobacco products under the national laws and regulations and labour rights violations. If UNEP IETC finds any risk, UNEP IETC immediately share it with IETC Principal Coordinator, Division Director and other relevant units, including the Private Sector Unit.\n',636,'2021-10-25 00:13:01',NULL,NULL,0),(4673,2614,4741,0,NULL,2,'ComparativeReview','agreements','As discussed, please upload further detail on the above beyond what is in the agreement.',3266,'2021-10-25 10:36:48',NULL,NULL,0),(4674,2248,4687,0,NULL,2,'AgreementDocuments','agreements','please look at the agreement and the annexes reflected, very confusing and duplicating=> clean up the Documents, i.e. the Annexes: remove duplicate, remove the expenditure format old from we collaborate otherwise we confuse IP AND WBSE on the agreement is different from budget => which is correct??',664,'2021-10-25 10:40:11',NULL,NULL,0),(4675,2248,4687,NULL,NULL,2,'AgreementSummary','agreements','as explained in the post please revise',664,'2021-10-25 10:40:39',NULL,NULL,0),(4676,2614,4741,0,NULL,2,'AgreementDeliverables','agreements','Please connect in the future explicitly to the Outputs and relevant Outcome(s) in the Programme of Work project (522.4) that this work contributes to under this section.

The activities listed in this agreement aim to improve the science-policy knowledge base around the issue of sand and sustainability. The ultimate aim, following the identification and mapping of sand extraction, sand use and quantity of sand being used, is to develop guidance for national regulatory frameworks for sand and sustainability. The content of this guidance could be seen as a first step towards a global standard or certification scheme on sand extraction.”\n\n4.	Under Clause 2, we note that the clause below has been added. Since these information have been included in other provisions of the Agreement namely Clause 5 and Clause 7, we propose deletion of this clause from Clause 2. \n\n‘UNEP shall:\na.	Provide UniGe with the financial resources of USD 150,000.00 (One hundred and fifty thousand) through this SSFA.\nb.

Also, please note that not all the SSFAs that you either appended to your e-mail below or are posted in the Portal had been cleared by the Legal Unit. While the Portal is meant to trigger legal review whenever substantive deviations like these are introduced in the agreements, but for some technical errors not all those agreements prompted request for legal review/clearance in the system. \n\nWith reference to the specific text proposed by University of Geneva under Clause 15a of your SSFA, and purely from the legal standpoint, our position and advice remains the same: Regarding the Clause on limited liability, please note that generally we do not accept any limitation on liability, since it may prevent UNEP from being adequately compensated for the contractor\'s failure to perform its obligations. While a limitation clause may be good for the contractor, ultimately the Member States and their taxpaying citizens will bear the cost of such a provision. According to the standard process, UNEP needs to get prior approval of the UN controller on the agreed limitation, before we accept a clause on limited liability.\n\nIn light of the above, we would reiterate our earlier comment and suggest that in lieu of University of Geneva’s proposed text under Clause 15a, you retain the original text from our SSFA template which states: ‘[The Partner] shall be solely and completely responsible and accountable for all services performed by its personnel, agents, employees, or contractors (hereinafter referred to as “Personnel”)’. As we had shared with you earlier, there are a number of SSFAs with University of Geneva where our standard text under the liability/responsibility provision had been accepted by the University. For ease of reference, I am appending herewith a copy of a recent SSFA where our standard clause had been accepted by the University of Geneva (please see Clause 16a of the attached document titled: SSFA_Unige_Including UNEP’s standard liability-responsibility clause). This SSFA was for our Vienna Office, which was concluded by both parties in December 2020.\n\nPlease note that the role of the Legal Unit in Corporate Services Division is to provide advice, and further to such advice, clear -or not- draft agreements. Decisions are to be made by Senior Managers under their responsibility and delegated authority. In line with the Delegation of Authority Policy and Framework, it is within the delegation of authority of the Directors to decide about the signing of agreements, even if they include clauses not cleared by us. It is for them to take the decision on the basis of weighing up the risk and benefit of each specific situation, the probability and impact of the risk .\n',2079,'2021-11-04 06:07:49',NULL,NULL,0);

The main objective of the fund is to provide financial support, wholly or partially, for the functioning of the organs of the Conference and the implementation of its activities and to ensure a sustainable financial basis for the Conference. The Constitution provides that pledges of contributions to the general trust fund shall be made at each session of the Conference and that the fund shall be an agenda item at each ordinary session of the Conference.\r\nThe general trust fund was established on the basis of voluntary contributions. However, at the sixth session of the Conference held in 1995, it was realized that only a few countries had made contributions to the fund. Aware of the importance of the fund as the main means of resource mobilization and the most important means of securing the commitments of African Governments to the Conference, it was felt that mandatory contributions would be necessary to mobilize the financial resources required to implement the activities of the Conference.'),(2,2,'English','The international meeting entitled “Stockholm+50: a healthy planet for the prosperity of all – our responsibility, our opportunity” was held in Stockholm on 2 and 3 June 2022, pursuant to General Assembly resolutions 75/280 and 75/326. During that period, four plenary meetings and three leadership dialogues were held. At the opening segment of the international meeting, a commemorative moment dedicated to the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment, held in Stockholm from 5 to 16 June 1972, was observed.');
